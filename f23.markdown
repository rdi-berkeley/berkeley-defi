## Participation

Each week, we will have a guest speaker do an "Ask Me Anything" session to answer your questions about the DeFi topic we covered that week. We expect in-person or online attendance in at least 10 of the AMA sessions, and require each student to ask at least 3 questions to speakers over the course of the semester. Questions should be posted to Edstem by the Sunday preceding each AMA. If you have a time conflict with another class or another reason you cannot regularly attend synchronous lectures, please make a private post on Edstem -- we will handle each case individually.

## Grading

The class will have short written homework and hands-on labs. Students enrolling in 1 unit are expected to submit an article that summarizes either a) one of the lectures or b) a topic from the [Future of Decentralization, AI, and Computing Summit](https://rdi.berkeley.edu/events/sbcberkeley) -- students enrolling in more than 1 unit will not have to submit an article. Students enrolling in 2 units or more are to complete weekly quizzes of equal weight (graded on completion). In addition, 3 and 4 unit students will participate in a group project (6 students per group), aiming to develop new solutions or analyze existing solutions and real-world deployment in DeFi, including a significant implementation component for 4 unit students.

<!-- Note: Students enrolled in the MBA and EWMBA versions of the course will not be required to complete programming labs. The grade distribution for MBA, EWMBA, and MFE students may vary from the one shown below. -->

### Summary Article

Students enrolled in 1 unit are expected to submit a summary article of one of the lectures. Alternatively, students that attend The [Future of Decentralization, AI, and Computing Summit](https://rdi.berkeley.edu/events/sbcberkeley) in-person may write an article summarizing a topic learned at the summit -- bonus points will be awarded for this option.

### Quizzes

All quizzes are released in parallel with (or shortly after) the corresponding lecture and will be due midnight the following Tuesday. Please remember to complete the quiz each week. Although it's graded on completion, we encourage you to do your best. The questions are all multiple-choice and there are usually at most 5 per quiz.

### Group Project

Students will be completing an open-ended research project culminating in a presentation and a workshop-style paper submitted at the end of the semester. You will choose an area of research in DeFi that you wish to explore and are encouraged to read related papers in that area. You will then identify an area that you believe needs improvement or merits further research and build systems and/or conduct experiments to further the state of the art within your chosen field. Students are welcome to choose their own topics, but we'll also provide a list of topic suggestions that you can take inspiration from if you wish. _Groups of 6 students are required. 3-credit and 4-credit students should not be in the same group._
More detail regarding group formation and logistics will be posted when necessary.

<!-- - **Group Formation**: After your group members are finalized, please choose a group name and fill out [this form](https://forms.gle/yvkcv26u1m61emeh6) (Due 09/12).
- **Project Proposal**: After your project idea and logistics are finalized, please fill out [this form](https://forms.gle/Vnmizcn6S8qpCefVA) (Due 10/03). -->

<!--
### Bonus Points: CESC

This year, Berkeley RDI will be hosting the [Crypto Economics Security Conference (CESC)](https://cesc.io/) from Oct 31 to Nov 1. There will be no AMA that week. Instead, we highly recommend that you attend CESC to learn more about DeFi topics you may be interested in. All students who attend CESC and produce a short written report about one or more interesting presentations at the conference will be awarded bonus points in the course. Students who are participating in a course project will be eligible for additional bonus points if they present their project at the CESC poster session. If you are interested in taking advantage of either of these extra credit opportunities, please register as soon as possible at [CESC.io](https://cesc.io/). Registration is free, but capacity for in-person attendance is limited.
-->

<!--
The proposal should be submitted through [this google form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdnyIUra41NGD5RD9JfKApMIzJrHhwLi45cO2itZX17_zhVJw/viewform). The final report should be within **6 page** with additional appendix and references as needed (and total max 10 pages). For project presentation, each group needs to record a **3-min video** to summarize the results and findings of the project and need to submit the video (in mp4 format) and slides (in pdf format).

## Course Description

The purpose of this class is to bring together students and interdisciplinary experts in Computer Science and Finance to discuss the emerging area of Decentralized Finance (or DeFi). DeFi has experienced an unprecedented growth, with hundreds of projects and a countless stream of financial, distributed systems, and blockchain innovations. The total value locked (TVL) in decentralized finance — a measure of the total value of assets committed to the DeFi ecosystem — has reached over $80 billion. When compared to the traditional centralized finance (CeFi), DeFi offers products and services serving similar financial goals, but critically innovates with novel capabilities such as instantaneous multi-billion USD flash loans. By utilizing blockchain and smart contract technologies, DeFi as a whole aims to provide a new platform for programmable, automated finance services that remove the reliance on central trust and intermediaries.

Our goal is to provide a framework to understand this new area of financial services. For each finance function, we will consider 1) the current intermediated structure, and then b) the DeFi version (actual or proposed) that fulfills the function. Is either one of these optimal? We will evaluate both through the lens of CS and finance. Is the application computable (efficiency, decidable), programmable (automatic)? Is the application welfare-enhancing and stable (not a source of systemic risk). How do the new and old systems interact? We aim for the students to be able to critically evaluate whether a new DeFi protocol is novel and practical. We further will capture the security danger in DeFi, as well as their impact on the underlying consensus security. Lastly, we hope to give an insight into how to program and structure secure and incentive-compatible DeFi applications.

Through the exposure to cutting-edge research as well as remaining open challenges, we hope for our students to quickly integrate into academic as well as industrial projects related to DeFi.

Summarizing, we will cover a broad spectrum of topics, including:

1. A comprehensive introduction covering a computer science and finance background required for the remainder of the course. We will discuss the basics of decentralized systems, permissionless blockchains, consensus, smart contracts and contrast DeFi to traditional finance.

2. We will cover the computer science and economic aspects of DeFi assets, and how they link to CeFi through stablecoins. The course will elaborate on DeFi asset exchanges and contrast the traditional limit order book models to automated market makers. Just like in CeFi, debt and derivatives play a fundamental role in DeFi. We’ll dive into the various debt models, such as under- and over-collateralized debt, as well as synthetic assets in DeFi. Insurances, portfolio management and prediction markets form equally crucial elements to a decentralised economy as we will elaborate on. Last but not least, we will show different attempts at measuring and tracking systemic risk and its computability.

3. To link blockchains with financial information from the real-world, we will provide a deep-dive into oracles. We will discuss decentralized reputation, identities and proof of properties. Because most DeFi is transparently readable, including transaction amounts, fees, dates/times, etc, privacy plays an increasingly important role in DeFi. We will cover various privacy technologies including zero-knowledge proofs and their applications in DeFi. We will also discuss various attempts at how to enforce data ownership, data monetization and valuation as well as controlled use and misuse of data.

4. A digital economy would not thrive without strong security. We will outline the many past security attacks, introspect a few of them in closer detail and provide recommendations on how to strengthen DeFi security. We will discuss the systemic risks stemming from Miner Extractable Value (MEV) and how MEV can be minimized by design. Decentralized governance provides power to a pseudonymous collective, and we will explore how governance works, and how it may be attacked.
